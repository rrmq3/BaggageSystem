1. How I worked on this?
The project consists of two different packages
1. Model
2. Implementation


I have initially modeled the project by dividing the model into three different classes.
1. Edge.java: Departures section
2. Graph.java: Conveyor System section


So sections you have mentioned in the problem Conveyor system, Departures and Bags are modeled using the three classes.
The business logic is implemented using the DijiktraAlgorithm.java where all the minimum and time calculations are made.

Also I have created a JUnit test case  TestDijikstraAlgorithm where we can run the program and see the expected output.


How to Run?
You can run the project by using the Junit test case I have created where the inputs are inserted in the test case and the
output is given.
